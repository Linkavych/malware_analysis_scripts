# Scripts for Malware Analysis

This is a general collection of scripts that I have written/am writing to assist in
conducting malware analysis. They are organized generally by function, but may not be perfect.

For instance: `samples/` contains scripts for obtaining samples from various sources.
`sandbox/` contains scripts for obtaining information from various public/private sandboxes
for malware analysis. Assume these are always a work-in-progress, but I hope they help where
they might!
