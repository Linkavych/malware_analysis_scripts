# String Decryption

Decrypting strings is a common challenge in malware analysis. Malware authors routinely
employ a variety of algorithms to obscure their malware and make it more difficult
for analysts to determine its capabilities. Often, decrypting these strings is a critical
first step in determining the full capabilities of the malware, and allows defenders
to create better detections to protect their environments.
