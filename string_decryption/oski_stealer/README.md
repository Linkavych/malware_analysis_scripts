## Challenge

This was an analysis challenge from @Overfl0w_ and the [zero2automated](https://www.zero2auto.com) discord.

> This time the initial layer is developed in .NET, however the payload you'll be needing is developed in C/C++, so you'll first have to unpack the .NET layer(s). Once you've got the core payload, that is when the real challenge starts; your goal is to identify how the strings are encrypted and stored within the Oski Stealer sample and develop a script to automate decryption of said strings, preferably within the context of a disassembler (such as using IDAPython, Python API for Cutter, Ghidra, etc.)
